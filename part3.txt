After running the simulations, the results show that having multiple servers decrease the latency (time before a request is processed).
This is because for cases like the given input:

7, /images/test.gif, 1
7, /images/header.jpg, 1

In a single server, the request to header.jpg must wait for test.gif request to finish even though they arrived at the same time (7th second).
For multiple servers, this problem is reduced by evenly distributing request over the available servers via round-robin
